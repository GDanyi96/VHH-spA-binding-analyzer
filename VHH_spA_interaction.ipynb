        "\n",
        "## *Description*\n",
        "A bioinformatics tool to aid the rational design of **Protein A-binding VHH sequences**. The algorithm is based on an open-access article  [(Henry KA et al.,2016)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163113) that describes a mutagenesis-based strategy to investigate Staphylococcal protein A (**SpA**) binding to VHH backbones.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tool translates the experimentally validated findings (by surface plasmon resonance) of this article into an easy-to-use tool that **accepts a VHH sequence as an input and informs the user about potential interaction SpA**. Furthermore, it reports which residues could have destabilizing effects on the SpA binding interface\n",
        "\n",
        "## *Usage*\n",
        "\n",
        "Use the tool by entering a VHH amino acid sequence as well as its name. On the toolbar, click **Runtime > Run all** or press Ctrl + F9. Results of the analysis should appear below. In order to  perform the analysis with another sequence, start\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## *Limitations*\n",
        "\n",
        "The tool is solely based on the article mentioned, which does not investigate all the possible amino-acid substitutions experimentally. Ideally, the generated results are subject to *in vitro* and/or *in silico* validation. The paper reports that no  adverse effects on expression yield and binding affinity to the target were recognized was observed when introducing the SpA-binding enhancing substitutions, although this is only based on 5 different VHHs against 3 different targets. This can be different in the case of various substitutions and recombinant expression hosts that are not investigated in the paper. Additionally, be advised that there are several recombinant SpA proteins on the market that potentially differ in their exact sequence, which could lead to different structures and altered binding to the VHH."
